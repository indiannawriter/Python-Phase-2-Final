# Python-Phase-2-Final
Nick wrote the first section to set us up for success. He ensured that the data was properly formatted from Phase 1; isolated the necessary columns; created the KM
model with the prescribed number of clusters and had the code ready to hand off to Anna.

Anna did the second section using Nick's section one. She created a range, the inertia values and used the output to determine 
the optimal number of clusters. From there, she began work on the normalization section, but there were some issues around the fit of the data.

Hannah also built on Nick's work to produce the standard deviation output and visualization for the third section. She created the graphic and reviewed which
features had variation.

The last section was a group effort. Nick had revised some code after Anna had seen some errors and we sought guidance. 
We discussed how to move forward at this point. What we have in the end is that when we run our code in Spyder, 
Anna's code in section two will run with no errors, but Hannah's will not. 
In Jypyter notebook, Hannah's code looks great, and Anna's fails. 
For this section, despite our frustration, we collaborated well and tried several alternatives,
but no single piece solved all of the issues. 
What you will see is a group effort with varying results dependent on where you run the 
data.
